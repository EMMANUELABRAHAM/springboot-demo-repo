## Introduction
This project serves as a playground for learning Spring Boot, focusing on essential aspects of modern web development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project provides a hands-on experience with building APIs, connecting to databases, and handling file storage.

## Features
- **API Creation**: Learn to build RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.
- **Database Connections**: Explore different ways to connect and interact with databases.
- **File Storage**: Understand how to handle file uploads, storage, and retrieval.
- **Gradual Complexity**: Start simple and gradually introduce more complex concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Your favorite IDE with Spring Boot support]

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:

[https://github.com/EMMANUELABRAHAM/springboot-demo.git](https://github.com/EMMANUELABRAHAM/springboot-demo-repo.git)
  
#### Build the project using Maven:
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Then, run the following command:

   `mvn clean install`
   
This command will clean the project, compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

#### Run the application:
After successfully building the project, run the application using the following command:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

This command will start the Spring Boot application. Once it's up and running, you can access the APIs and test the functionality.
